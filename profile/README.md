**Chromatin Systems Biology**

Our lab investigates the fundamental regulatory logic of the genome. We believe that understanding cellular health and disease requires connecting the dots across multiple regulatory layers within the same cell.

We use and develop single-cell multimodal methods to measure these layers simultaneously (e.g., histone modifications, transcription factor binding, gene expression) within individual cells. Through computational approaches, we connect chromatin biology to transcription to understand how cells function in health and disease.
